description: Where Tau stores state, and the shape of its config files.
---

Tau keeps durable state in your home directory (`~/.tau/`) and reads
project-local resources from your working directory. This page is a reference for
those locations and file formats.

## Tau home

```text
~/.tau/
├── catalog.toml        # optional provider/model catalog overlay
├── providers.json      # provider/model preferences
├── credentials.json    # saved API keys / OAuth tokens (0600, atomic writes)
├── settings.json       # general settings (e.g. shell command prefix)
├── tui.json            # TUI theme, keybindings, and layout
├── sessions/           # saved sessions, per project
├── skills/             # user-level skills
├── prompts/            # user-level prompt templates
├── themes/             # user-level TUI themes
├── AGENTS.md           # global project instructions
└── logs/               # diagnostics
```

Tau also reads user-level `.agents` resources: `~/.agents/skills/`,
`~/.agents/prompts/`, `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`.

Startup update checks cache their latest PyPI result in
`~/.tau/cache/update-check.json` and refresh at most once per day. Set
`TAU_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable the check; Tau also skips it when `CI` is set.

## Network proxies

Tau uses `httpx` for provider requests, OAuth token refreshes, and startup update
checks, so it honors standard proxy environment variables such as `HTTP_PROXY`,
`HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`.

SOCKS proxies are supported by the base installation. Use explicit schemes when
you can:

```bash
export ALL_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
# or, when proxy-side DNS resolution is required:
export ALL_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080
```

Tau also accepts the generic `socks://` form that some systems and tools set in
the environment. Before creating its own HTTP clients, Tau normalizes
`socks://...` to `socks5://...` because `httpx` does not recognize the generic
scheme directly.

This matters for users behind corporate proxies, VPNs, local tunnels, or
privacy/network-routing setups: without SOCKS support and normalization, Tau can
fail before making a model API request with an error like
`Unknown scheme for proxy URL URL('socks://...')`.

## Providers

Tau separates provider metadata from runtime preferences:

- `src/tau_coding/data/catalog.toml` ships the built-in provider/model catalog.
- `~/.tau/catalog.toml` optionally adds personal providers or overlays built-ins.
- `~/.tau/providers.json` stores runtime preferences such as the default provider,
  default model, scoped models, headers, and timeout/retry settings.

Tau intentionally reads catalog overlays only from the user-level
`~/.tau/catalog.toml`. There is no project-level `.tau/catalog.toml`, so cloning a
repository cannot silently redirect a provider's `base_url` or credentials to an
unexpected service.

### Provider catalog overlays

Add reusable custom provider definitions to `~/.tau/catalog.toml`:

```toml
schema_version = 1

[[providers]]
name = "local-gateway"
display_name = "Local Gateway"
kind = "openai-compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
api_key_env = "LOCAL_GATEWAY_API_KEY"
credential_name = "local-gateway"
models = ["qwen-coder"]
default_model = "qwen-coder"
docs_url = "https://example.test/local-gateway"

[providers.context_windows]
qwen-coder = 64000
```

Catalog entries support `kind` values of `openai-compatible`, `anthropic`, and
`openai-codex`. For most custom services, start with `openai-compatible`.

User catalog overlays can be partial when they use the same `name` as a built-in
provider. Scalar fields replace built-in values, `models` are merged with user
models first, and `context_windows` are merged. Model metadata is merged by model;
its `headers`, `compat`, and `thinking_level_map` mappings are merged, while other
metadata fields—including the complete `cost_tiers` array—replace the built-in
value. The thinking fields (`thinking_levels`, `thinking_models`,
`thinking_default`, `thinking_parameter`) replace as a group when
`thinking_levels` is present.

`catalog.toml` does not store runtime request options such as custom HTTP
headers, timeouts, or retry settings. Put those in `~/.tau/providers.json` on the
matching provider entry.

Invalid catalog files fail loudly. Tau rejects unknown keys, empty required
strings, empty model names, unsupported provider kinds, default models that are
not listed in `models`, `thinking_models` or `context_windows` entries for
unknown models, and non-positive or non-integer context-window values.

Model metadata can retain a backward-compatible flat `cost` and optionally
provide ordered `cost_tiers` for rates that depend on input size:

```toml
[providers.model_metadata."long-context-model"]
cost = { input = 0.3, output = 1.2, cacheRead = 0.06, cacheWrite = 0 }
cost_tiers = [
  { max_input_tokens = 512000, input = 0.3, output = 1.2, cacheRead = 0.06, cacheWrite = 0 },
  { input = 0.6, output = 2.4, cacheRead = 0.12, cacheWrite = 0 },
]
```

Limits are inclusive, must increase strictly, and the final tier must omit
`max_input_tokens` so every valid input size has a rate. Callers that understand
tiers should select the first tier whose limit includes the input-token count;
older callers continue to see `cost` as the base rate.

### Provider preferences

Provider preferences live in `~/.tau/providers.json`:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "local-gateway",
  "provider_preferences": {
    "local-gateway": {
      "default_model": "qwen-coder",
      "headers": { "X-Provider-Header": "value" },
      "thinking_defaults": { "qwen-coder": "low" },
      "timeout_seconds": 120,
      "max_retries": 2,
      "max_retry_delay_seconds": 0.5
    }
  },
  "scoped_models": [
    { "provider": "local-gateway", "model": "qwen-coder" }
  ]
}
```

- `provider_preferences` keys must refer to providers from the effective catalog
  (`src/tau_coding/data/catalog.toml` plus `~/.tau/catalog.toml`).
- `headers` is optional (string→string). For example, Hugging Face organization
  billing can be configured with `"headers": { "X-HF-Bill-To": "my-org" }` on
  the `huggingface` provider preference. `thinking_defaults` remembers the
  preferred thinking level per model for new sessions; resumed sessions still use
  their session history. `timeout_seconds` defaults to `60` (> 0); `max_retries`
  defaults to `2`; `max_retry_delay_seconds` defaults to `1` (both ≥ 0).
  Retries cover transient HTTP statuses (`408`, `409`, `425`, `429`, `5xx`),
  transport errors, and — for the OpenAI Codex provider — transient in-stream
  SSE error events such as `server_is_overloaded` that arrive on an otherwise
  successful HTTP 200 response.
- API keys and OAuth credentials are **not** stored here — they live in
  `~/.tau/credentials.json` (private but not encrypted). OAuth objects may contain
  provider metadata such as a GitHub Enterprise domain and are refreshed
  automatically. Resolution order: stored credential, then the env
  var named by `api_key_env`.
- The selected model must be present in that provider's `models` list. Add
  custom or local model names to `models` before using them as defaults,
  CLI/TUI selections, or scoped models.
- `scoped_models` are favorites for the **Ctrl+P** quick-cycle.
- Older `providers.json` files that contain full `providers` entries are still
  accepted for compatibility. Tau ignores unrecognized top-level settings and
  provider-preference fields so files written by newer Tau versions do not block
  older versions from starting. Recognized fields remain strictly validated.
  When Tau saves settings again, provider definitions are moved to
  `~/.tau/catalog.toml` and `providers.json` is rewritten as runtime preferences.
- Custom models declare thinking support in `catalog.toml` with
  `thinking_levels`, `thinking_default`, `thinking_models`, and
  `thinking_parameter` (`"reasoning_effort"`, `"reasoning.effort"`, or
  `"anthropic.thinking"`).

Writes after `/login`, `/model`, or scoped-model changes reload the file first,
apply only the requested change, write atomically, and keep a `.bak` backup.

See the [Providers & models guide]({{< relref "../guides/providers-and-models.md" >}}) for usage.

## Shell settings

Tau runs shell commands in a **non-interactive** shell — both terminal-input
commands (`! gst`, `!! ll`) and the agent's `bash` tool. Non-interactive shells
don't load your aliases from `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`, and Tau deliberately
never reads those files (they can hold tokens and side effects).

To make your own aliases available, opt in with a `shellCommandPrefix` in
`~/.tau/settings.json` that loads a small Tau-specific alias file:

```bash
# ~/.tau/shell-aliases.bash
alias gst='git status'
alias ga='git add'
alias gc='git commit'
```

```json
{
  "shellCommandPrefix": "shopt -s expand_aliases\nsource ~/.tau/shell-aliases.bash"
}
```

Then start a new session and try `! gst`. Notes:

- Commands run through bash-style non-interactive execution, so keep aliases
  POSIX/bash-compatible (zsh-only syntax, functions, or interactive startup
  logic may not work).
- Changing `settings.json` affects **new** sessions; an already-running session
  keeps the prefix it started with.
- The snake_case key `shell_command_prefix` is also accepted.
- Unrecognized fields are ignored for compatibility with newer Tau versions;
  recognized fields remain strictly validated.

## TUI settings

The built-in frontend reads optional settings from `~/.tau/tui.json`:

```json
{
  "theme": "high-contrast",
  "sidebar_position": "right",
  "turn_notification": "desktop",
  "keybindings": {
    "cancel": "escape",
    "command_palette": "ctrl+k",
    "session_picker": "ctrl+r",
    "queue_follow_up": "alt+enter",
    "accept_completion": "tab",
    "completion_next": "down",
    "completion_previous": "up",
    "thinking_cycle": "shift+tab",
    "model_cycle": "ctrl+p",
    "toggle_thinking": "ctrl+t",
    "toggle_tool_results": "ctrl+o",
    "copy_message": "ctrl+c",
    "quit": "ctrl+d"
  }
}
```

Built-in themes: `tau-dark` (default), `tau-light`, `high-contrast`. Custom
themes are JSON files in `~/.tau/themes/` or a project's `.tau/themes/` — see
[Themes]({{< relref "../guides/themes.md" >}}). Set one with `/theme`.
Textual's native theme picker is mapped to the same Tau themes and persists
the same `theme` setting. A configured theme that cannot be found falls back
to `tau-dark` with a startup notice, without overwriting the setting. Keys use
Textual syntax; omitted keys keep their defaults. Tau ignores unrecognized
settings and keybinding names so a `tui.json` written by a newer Tau version does
not prevent an older version from starting. Recognized settings remain strict:
Tau rejects invalid values, empty keys, and duplicate assignments.

- `sidebar_position`: `"right"` (default), `"left"`, or `"off"`. Controls
  placement of the session metadata sidebar. `"off"` hides the sidebar entirely;
  the compact session info row below the prompt still works.
- `turn_notification`: `"desktop"` (default), `"bell"`, or `"off"`. When Tau's
  terminal surface is unfocused and the agent becomes fully idle, `"desktop"`
  selects OSC 9 for Ghostty, iTerm2, and MinTTY, or Kitty's OSC 99 protocol for
  Kitty. Unknown terminals receive no sequence rather than an incompatible one.
  `"bell"` explicitly emits the standard terminal bell so the terminal can mark
  the tab or request attention instead; depending on terminal settings, BEL may
  play a sound. Desktop notifications can also use the operating system's
  configured notification sound. No notification is emitted while Tau has focus.

## Sessions

```text
~/.tau/sessions/<cleaned-path>-<short-hash>/
```

Each working directory gets its own subdirectory; transcripts are append-only
JSONL preserving messages, model changes, and the active leaf of the session
tree. Metadata is indexed per project. See the
[Sessions guide]({{< relref "../guides/sessions.md" >}}).

## Skills, prompts & project context

Resource discovery order (later overrides earlier) is documented in
[Skills & prompt templates]({{< relref "../guides/skills-and-prompts.md" >}}) and
[Project instructions]({{< relref "../guides/project-instructions.md" >}}). In short: user-level
`~/.tau` and `~/.agents`, then project-level `.tau` and `.agents`, with
`AGENTS.md` discovered from the project root down to your current directory.

## Context

`/session` reports a rough context estimate and breakdown. Compact on demand
with `/compact`; on a context-overflow error Tau compacts and retries once.
Details in [Managing context]({{< relref "../guides/context.md" >}}).
